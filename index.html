<hl> My transcription of Knox's "Three Tracts." From the Second Tract:<hl/>
  <p> The British laws disown perpetual servitude, and the people of these islands have a general antipathy to slavery.</p>
  <p> The right of the planter to his Negroe is only founded on the acts of his provincial assembly, and beyond their jurisdicition he has no power over him.</p>
  <p> If he teaches his Negroe to read one book, he will of himself read another, and such has been the imprudence of some ill-informed writers, that books are not wanting to exhort the Negroes to rebel against their masters.</p>
  <p> Were the Negroes universally taught to read, and a late publication, which out of respect I forebear to name, put into their hands and circulated among them, there would be little doubt that the next ships informed us of a general insurrection of the Negroes, and the massacre of their owners; and yet the writer's intention was certainly to engage the planter to have his Negroes instructed.</p>
